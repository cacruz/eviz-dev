# Eviz Data Source Architecture Design

## Overview

Based on the requirements to handle various earth-system model data formats (NetCDF, HDF5, CSV, GRIB), I've designed and implemented a flexible, extensible data source architecture for the Eviz project. This architecture follows object-oriented design principles and incorporates several design patterns to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: The architecture is open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clients only need to know about the methods they use
5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Common functionality is abstracted into base classes and utilities

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Sources

The core of the architecture is the `DataSource` abstract base class, which defines the interface for all data sources. Specific implementations are provided for each supported file format:

- `NetCDFDataSource`: For NetCDF files
- `HDF5DataSource`: For HDF5 files
- `CSVDataSource`: For CSV files
- `GRIBDataSource`: For GRIB files

Each implementation handles the specifics of reading and processing its respective file format while adhering to a common interface.

### 2. Factory Pattern

The `DataSourceFactory` class implements the Factory pattern to create appropriate data source instances based on file extensions. This allows the system to:

- Automatically detect file formats
- Create the appropriate data source instance
- Support custom data source types through registration

The factory uses a registry (`DataSourceRegistry`) to maintain mappings between file extensions and data source classes.

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline consists of several stages, each handling a specific aspect of data processing:

- `DataReader`: Reads data from files using the appropriate data source
- `DataProcessor`: Processes data (standardizing coordinates, handling missing values, etc.)
- `DataTransformer`: Transforms data (regridding, subsetting, averaging, etc.)
- `DataIntegrator`: Integrates data from multiple sources or variables

These components are combined in the `DataPipeline` class, which provides a unified interface for the entire data processing workflow.

```

## Key Features

1. **Unified Interface**: All data sources provide a consistent interface regardless of the underlying file format
2. **Automatic Format Detection**: The system automatically detects file formats based on extensions
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Each data source extracts and provides access to metadata
4. **Data Processing**: Common data processing operations are provided (coordinate standardization, unit conversion, etc.)
5. **Data Transformation**: Advanced transformations like regridding, subsetting, and averaging are supported
6. **Data Integration**: Multiple data sources can be integrated into a single dataset
7. **Resource Management**: Resources are properly managed and released when no longer needed
8. **Extensibility**: New data source types can be easily added by implementing the `DataSource` interface and registering with the factory

## Example Usage

```python
from eviz.lib.data import DataPipeline

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = DataPipeline()

# Process multiple files
data_sources = pipeline.process_files(['file1.nc', 'file2.nc'])

# Transform a data source with regridding
transform_params = {
    'regrid': True,
    'target_grid': {'lat_res': 1.0, 'lon_res': 1.0}
}
data_source = pipeline.process_file('file.nc', transform=True, transform_params=transform_params)

# Integrate data sources
dataset = pipeline.integrate_data_sources()

# Integrate variables
dataset = pipeline.integrate_variables(['var1', 'var2'], 'add', 'var_sum')

# Clean up
pipeline.close()
```

## Benefits of This Design

1. **Modularity**: Components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
2. **Flexibility**: The system can handle various file formats and data structures
3. **Extensibility**: New data source types can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Reusability**: Common functionality is abstracted and reused across components
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and maintain
6. **Scalability**: The architecture can scale to handle additional file formats and processing requirements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Parallel Processing**: Add support for parallel processing of large datasets
2. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance
3. **Additional File Formats**: Add support for more file formats as needed
4. **Advanced Transformations**: Implement more advanced data transformation operations
5. **Visualization Integration**: Integrate with visualization components for seamless data visualization
