This directory contains several directories for all the data source types 
that EViz supports and for which a variety of config files are provided.

Note the config files specify the location of the data as well
as the output path of the visualizations. Both of these paths
are assumed to be in the $HOME directory of the user. The data 
is in

$HOME/data/eviz  (multiple subdirectories will be here)

the output is in

$HOME/scratch/eviz/output  (multiple subdirectories will be here).

In the APP YAML file, these paths are specified as follows:

inputs:
   - name     : ${HOME}/data/eviz/airnow/HourlyAQObs*
     description: 25 Î¼m particulate matter
     reader   : csv
     to_plot  :
        PM25: sc

outputs:
    output_dir: ${HOME}/scratch/eviz/output/airnow
    print_to_file: yes


Change ${HOME} to whatever path works in your case. This can (and should) 
be done via environment variables.
